Suppose that i is a variable of type int, j is a variable of type long, and k is a variable of
type unsigned int. What is the type of the expression i + (int) j * k?

before
i int
j float
k uint

after
float(j) converts to int
j converts to uint to operate with k
i converts to uint to operate with k

R= uint
