Assume that a program contains the following declarations:
char c = '\1';
short s = 2;
int i = -3;
long m = 5;
float f = 6.5f;
double d = 7.5;
Give the value and the type of each expression listed below
(a) c * i -3 int
(c) f / c float 6.5
(e) f - d -1.0 double
(b) s + m 7 long
(d) d / s 3.75 double
(f) (int)f 6 int
